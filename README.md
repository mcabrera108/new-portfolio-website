# New Portfolio Website

Hello! This is my new portfolio website that will be replacing my old one. I went into this website with the philosophy of bringing my personal interests to life while making something stylish to show off my growth as an engineer.

The stack for this website is made using:

React + Vite + Typescript + SCSS with Netlify handling form submissions.
